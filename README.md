Figure S1: A: Percentage of each base (A, C, G, T) for L. donovani promastigotes (blue), amastigotes (orange), and radicicol-treated promastigotes (green), n = 3. Since reads are reverse-complement, G indicates the incorporation of a biotinylated CTP at the end of the pre-mRNA. B: Distribution of read lengths (bp) with the number of reads and the length plotted. 

Figure S2: The distribution of mean PRO-seq reads of L. donovani across all 62 transcription initiation sites. dSSRs are highlighted in gray, with dashed lines marking the start of the PTUs. The first 5,000 bp of the PTU is plotted. Promastigotes are shown in blue; amastigotes are shown in orange, and radicicol-treated promastigotes are shown in green, n = 3. The turquoise line represents genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III. 

Figure S3: The distribution of mean PRO-seq reads of L. donovani across all 48 transcription termination sites. cSSRs are highlighted in gray, with dashed lines marking the end of the PTUs. The last 5,000 bp of the PTU plotted. Promastigotes are shown in blue; amastigotes are shown in orange, and radicicol-treated promastigotes are shown in green, n = 3. The turquoise line represents genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III.
